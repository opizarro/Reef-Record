\subsection{Repeatability for monitoring purposes}
Given a printout of the mosaic from a previous survey and the georeferenced location of the center of the reef record, an experienced swimmer can relocate the central point in seconds to a few minutes, depending on how much the site has changed. The typical procedure was to approach the site by boat using a hand-held GPS and dropping the pole near the desired location, or using the platform's display to guide the swimmer to the GPS coordinates.
If the particular application allows leaving the star picket embedded in the substrate, relocating the survey site is trivial. This approach will be robust to substantial changes in appearance that can occur after events such as large storms.
Figure T presents examples of revisited sites on Lizard Island for April 2014, October 2014 and May 2015.
