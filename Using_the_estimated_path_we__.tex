Using the estimated path, we produce a 3D mesh of the surface by generating a mesh using each camera pair and stitching these together.  We then project a blended texture map onto the surface to yield a thee dimensional model of the seafloor covered by the reef record.  Figure~\ref{fig:horseshoe_mosaic} shows an example of the texture mapped model for one of the reef records while Figure~\ref{fig:horseshoe_depth} shows the underly three dimensional surface model.
