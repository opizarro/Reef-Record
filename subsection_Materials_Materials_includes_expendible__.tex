\subsection{Materials}
%"Materials" includes expendible and non-expendible supplies, equipment, and solutions. Materials should be listed as completely as possible, with careful attention to providing enough information to assist new users in adopting the method. Descriptions of needed equipment must note the essential features of the equipment in sufficient detail to allow users to obtain similar devices, or authors may refer to specific commercial products in lieu of a detailed description. The composition of any solutions must be stated explicitly (e.g. grams per liter of a specific compound).
We rely on three three major components for the data acquisition
\begin{enumerate}
\item stereo imaging package. An updated version of the one used in \cite{Henderson_2013} \cite{Camilli_2007}, integrated into a smaller package. We require properly calibrated stereo pair and sensor suite, as well as the pose of each sensor relative to the navigation center \cite{Johnson_Roberson_2013} \cite{Mahon_2008}.
\item drum and line. Typically a series of reef records are collect. Prior to starting, it is important to select the diameter of the drum and lenght of the line to determine the size of the patch and the image overlap from the spiral spacing. The resulting pattern will have the form shown in Figure \ref{fig:spiral}.
