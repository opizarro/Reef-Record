Surveys based on state of the art visual 3D reconstruction techniques can provide rich structural information in addition to traditional community composition. In general, they have co-evolved with the use of underwwater robotics since the additional navigation suite helps georeference the reconstructions as well as allow for systematic coverage of areas much larger than the footprint of a single image. We present a simple method to generate repeatable, high resolution (~1mm^{2}) and large extent (~100m^{2}) surveys that can be performed with a single diver in around 15 minutes. The survey data can then be used in an automated processing pipeline to generate georeferenced 3D reconstructions, orthographically projected mosaics and structural complexity indeces. Georeferenced imagery is integrated into a convenient online labelling interface.
