State of the art visual 3D reconstruction techniques can provide rich ecological and structural information from underwater imagery. When coupled with underwater robotics, the additional navigation suite helps to georeference the reconstructions as well as allow for systematic coverage of areas much larger than the footprint of a single image. However, access to suitable robotic systems is limited and requires specialised operators, which reduces the widespread use of these techniques. Furthermore, field conditions are often poor, especially in shallow habitats, and human control of equipment is required;
