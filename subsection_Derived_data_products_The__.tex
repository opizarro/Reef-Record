\subsection{Derived data products}
The systematic survey with sufficient image overlap allows for successful processing with SLAM or Structure from Motion tools. We present results using the ACFR's \cite{Mahon_2008} and \cite{Johnson_Roberson_2010}\cite{Johnson_Roberson_2010} 
3D mosaic
bathymetry
structural complexity
spatial distribution of variables... Josh's figure?
