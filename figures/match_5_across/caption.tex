/label{fig:across_track} Feature matches between two stereo pairs (top row and bottom row) across two revolutions of the spiral pattern. The colored lines start and end points correspond to the same feature on the first pair and second pair. The reduced overlap results in fewer matches when compared to Figure /ref{fig:along_track}.
