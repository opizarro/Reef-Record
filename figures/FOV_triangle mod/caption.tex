\label{fig:fov} Footprint, $b$, seen by a down-looking camera with with angle of view of $\beta$ at an altitude of $h$. In general, the aspect ratio of imaging sensors is not square so that angle of view across track (across direction of motion) and along track are different. We refer to these by subscripts $\beta_{across}$ and $\beta_{along}$ and likewise for the corresponding footprints $b_{across}$ and $b_{along}$.
