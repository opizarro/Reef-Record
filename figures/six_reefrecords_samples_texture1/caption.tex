\label{fig:six_samples} Six reef records collected at sites around Lizard Island showing the variability in the reef structure. Each record covers an area of approximately 110 m$^2$. These are rendered as the othographic projection of the image-textured mosaics. The variability in cover is readily apparent. From top left: Resort, South Island, Washing Machine, North Reef 3, North Reef 1,  Horsehoe 2 (NOT ON MAP, OSCAR, WHAT ABOUT USING LAGOON 2?)
