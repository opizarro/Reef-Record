\label{fig:survey_length} Contours of constant survey path length in meters, as a function of drum diameter (or spacing between revolutions) and desired survey area. The drum diameter sets the spacing between revolutions and should be selected considering the camera footprint (Fig. \ref{fig:footprint}) and desired overlap. The blue marker indicates the survey design used to generate the results presented in this paper, with a drum diameter of 0.16m and an approximate survey area of 113m$^2$.
