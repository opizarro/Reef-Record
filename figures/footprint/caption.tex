\label{fig:footprint} Contours of constant footprint $b$ in meters as a function of altitude $h$ and angular field of view $\beta$. Across-track footprint (blue marker), along-track footprint (green marker) for the camera used to generate the results in this paper, with a target altitude of 2~m. The effect on footprint of a $\pm$0.5~m variation in altitude is illustrated by the range bars.
