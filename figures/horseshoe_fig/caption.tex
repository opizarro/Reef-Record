\label{fig:EcologicalProperties}Ecological properties quantified using reef records. (A) Coral species richness. Approximately 60\% of the colonies can be identified directly from the reef records. The remaining 40\%, which include difficult to identify and cryptic species, require identification in the field using colour printouts of the records on underwater paper or loading the records onto electronic slates (e.g., iPad and iDive). (B) Hard coral colony outlines are used to quantify the space occupied by different species and how this changes through time. (C) Bathymetry is used to calculate a range of habitat structural properties, including (D) rugosity (Friedman).  EcologicalProperties
