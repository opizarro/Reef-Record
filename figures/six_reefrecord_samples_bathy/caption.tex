\label{fig:reef_record_example_bathy} Six reef records collected at sites around Lizard Island showing the variability in the reef cover. Each record covers an area of approximately 110~m~$^2$. These are rendered as the othographic projection of the image-textured mosaics. The variability in cover is readily apparent. Clockwise, from top left: North Reef 3, Washing Machine, Easter Point, South Island, Lagoon 2 and Resort. See Fig. \ref{fig:six_samples} for the corresponding image-textured mosaics and Fig. \ref{fig:sitemap} for location of these sites around the island (red points).
