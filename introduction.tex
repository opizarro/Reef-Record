Structural complexity of a habitat is related to ecologists studying distribution and diversity of species. Traditional techniques to estimate rugosity, such as the chain method, are labour intensive, damage the environment and yield sparse coverage. Some improvements have been made to this approach \cite{Dustan_2013} but they still represent relatively sparse coverage with limited georeferencing. Recent advances in robotics and computer vision enable 3D reconstructions of bathymetry from which multi-scale structural complexity can be estimated quickly and reliably \cite{Friedman_2012}. These techniques rely on combining images into a composite reconstruction, and while they can scale to areas of tens or hundreds of meters consisting of thousands of images, they need a systematic way of covering the survey site. This is an ideal task for an underwater robot, which can be preprogrammed to follow a survey pattern to collect the desired imagery. However, the use of robots is still logistically complex, requiring specialised engineers in the field to operate and service the machines.
This paper presents a simple, low cost alternative to generate systematic surveys for visual 3D reconstructions of benthic habitats.
