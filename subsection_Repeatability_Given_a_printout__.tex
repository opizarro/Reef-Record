\subsection{Repeatability}
Given a printout of the mosaic from a previous survey and the georeferenced location of the center of the reef record, an experienced swimmer can relocate the central point in seconds to a few minutes, depending on how much the site has changed. The typical procedure was to approach the site by boat using a hand-held GPS and dropping the pole near the desired location, or using the platform's display to guide the swimmer to the GPS coordinates.
