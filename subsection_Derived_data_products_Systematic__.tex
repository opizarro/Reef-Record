\subsection{Derived data products}
Systematic surveys with sufficient image overlap allows for successful processing with SLAM or Structure from Motion tools. In addition to 3D reconstructions and 2D orthographic projections, derived quantities such as slope, aspect and structural complexity indices such as rugosity are straighforward to calculate at multiple scales \cite{Friedman_2012} (Fig. \ref{fig:EcologicalProperties}). Spatial distribution and abundance of benthic cover at scales beyond that of single image footprint are possible using specialized annotation tools or GIS packages.
